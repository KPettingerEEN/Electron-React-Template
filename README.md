# Main Details

This is an application template for making a basic Electron/React desktop App. Simply install the
dependencies, then run "npm run build" and "npm start" to see the basic layout that you can start
editing. This can be used for creating complex microservices that are capable of communicating with
both webservers and operating systems, making it perfect for full stack JavaScript development.
Electron leverages Node.js while being able to render and communicate with React interfaces as well,
so it can be used for creating PWAs without having to actually rebuild the application using services
like cocoa pods for iOS. Electron can also communicate with any OS by running batch files through
the framework so that you don't need to build a backend application for running batches and creating
automation features. As such, this makes this kind of microservice perfect for integrating into any
system. If you leverage this with services like AWS as shown in this example, you can create robust
and scalable systems that have less messy tech stacks and code bases, while still securing and
managing data better than you would with traditional systems.
